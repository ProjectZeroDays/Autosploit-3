# Autosploit
It is shell tool to automate the metasploit tool to create exploits and after that to get reverse tcp connection to attacker...

please Note that this trick works in the Same Network means both devices should be in same network(wifi or lan or what so ever)

also run in this linux environment where Metasploit framework is installed
Check Docummentation on https://www.metasploit.com/

to run
1. for very first time u need to change the mode by 'chmod 777 Autosploit.sh' once used then we don't have to use that again...
2. run by command ./Autosploit.sh in Linux Terminal

After running just follow the options to get your result.

here firstly you need to create exploit for specific OS like .apk , .exe , .dmg or some other depending on os all major Os are included
then save this exploit in victim's os
then start connection recive (Option No 6 : to start connection with victim when payload(sent exploit) is sent)
and then make sure that the Exploit in given OS will execute without any error

then we will get Reverse TCP connection to us
now we got the system do whatever you need to.... 
Just do not use this for illegal purpose as police is way smarter than this code at least...
